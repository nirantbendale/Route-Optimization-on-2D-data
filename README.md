# Route-Optimization-on-2D-data
This project is a delivery route optimization system designed to find efficient routes that minimize total travel distance. It considers delivery locations, a central depot, and petrol station stops. The algorithm combines greedy randomized construction, local search (2-opt), and a smart refueling stop insertion strategy.
